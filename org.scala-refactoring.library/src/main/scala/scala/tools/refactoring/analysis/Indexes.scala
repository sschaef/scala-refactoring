/**
 * The Indexes trait is mixed in by refactorings that need an index.
 * It provides several lookup functions to find references and decla-
 * rations of symbols.
 *
 * The IndexLookup trait has been separated into two traits: the
 * TrivialIndexLookup simply gives access to the underlying data,
 * whereas the IndexLookup that is used by clients contains more
 * expensive operations.
 *
 * An implementation can be found in GlobalIndexes.
